Activities define what the app does:

An activity is a special class usually written in Kotlin that control the app behaviror and decides how to respond to the use

Layout define what each scren look like:

Layouts are usually defined using XML, each screen can include components such as buttons, text, and images.


How activities and layouts work together when you run an app on device?

1. Android starts the app’s main activity.
2. The activity tells Android to use a specific layout.
3. The layout is displayed on the device.
4. The user interacts with the layout.
5. The activity responds to these interactions, and updates the
display…
6. …which the user sees on the device.
